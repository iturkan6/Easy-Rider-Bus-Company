# Easy-Rider-Bus-Company
<h3>1st stage of project</h3>
Description
You just started sorting out the existing database of the "Easy Rider" bus company. 
As you take the first look at the data, you realize that it's not going to be easy.

Sometimes numbers are missing from where they should definitely be. You also noticed 
that sometimes there are too many or too few characters. Fortunately, there is 
documentation to help you sort out this mess. However, this documentation is not a 
hundred percent complete: part of it was torn away when your colleague spilled coffee 
on it. Let's see what we can make out.
